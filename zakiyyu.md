# 1.0 INTRODUCTION 
## 1.0.1 Background  
Ojeil Construction Nigeria Limited has been entrusted with the 
Construction of 2No Bridges along Gwaram Basirka Road 
(Basirka 4 Span) at Basirka in Jigawa State. 
The Geo- Pendulum Limited was entrusted to carryout geotechnical 
investigation at the proposed site for the bridge. The report for deep 
soil investigations of the proposed bridge is presented here in. 

## 1.1 PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF WORK 
### 1.2.1 Purpose of Investigation  
The purpose of the geotechnical investigations is to carry out field 
work and laboratory tests, analyze data from these, and provide 
useful parameters to be used in the design and construction of the 
proposed bridge on the site. 
Specifically, analysis and recommendations shall cover the 
following: 
*  Comments upon strata  
*  Foundation options and bearing capacities. 
* Anticipated settlement appropriate for the different 
foundation solution with time relationship 
*  Sulphate characteristics and other deleterious chemical as 
may affect reinforced concrete. 
* Comments on ground water  


# 2.0 Laboratory Testing
> _Laboratory classification, strength, settlement and chemical tests were carried out on the undisturbed and disturbed samples of soil obtained from the overburden to improve on the field identification and classification tests._

The tests carried out include:
- Moisture Content Determination
- Specific Gravity Test
- Atterberg Limit Tests
- Particle Size Distribution Tests
- Shear Box Test
- Consolidation Test
- Chloride Content Test
- Sulphate Content Test

# 3.0 ANALYSIS OF BEARING CAPACITY AND SETTLEMENT   
**BEARING CAPACITY** 
The allowable bearing pressure imposed by a foundation is a function 
of characteristics of the shear strength of the soil as well as the depth 
and dimension of the foundation.

# 3.1 PILE CAPACITY ANALYSIS 
The pile capacities for 600mm, 800mm and 1000mm diameter piles are 
given in the table below: 
Safe Capacity For Bored Piles 
This method of calculating pile load capacity was suggested by Meyerhof. 

Meyerhof suggested the following equation, to calculate the ultimate pile 
load capacity in saturated sand strata, using standard penetration resistance 
(N). In the formula given below the 1st term gives the end bearing resistance 
of pile and the 2nd term gives the skin friction resistance of pile. 
Bored Piles  
Qu = 133NAb  + 0.67N’As   
Where, 
Qu = Ultimate total load in kN 

N = Average SPT value below pile tip 

N’= Average SPT value along the pile shaft 

As = Shaft surface area of pile in m2 

Ab = Base area of pile in m2 

Depth – 30m, 

Pile diameter = 0.6, 

Shaft Area, 
$As = 2{\pi}r$ = 2 x 3.142 x 0.3 x 30 = 56.556 m2 

N’ = 28 (from field results), 

```
Qu =  1060.991 kN 
Safe pile capacity Qs = Qu/FoS  where FoS = 2.5
Qs = 1060.991/2.5 
Qs= 424.40 KN
